# Pixel extractor 
Is a simple code written in python to extract the coordinates of pixels exceeding a certain threshold that can be set as input.

* The purpose is to check for hot or anomalous pixels by comparing pairs or series of images.

* The file therefore extracts the coordinates and the value in ADU of pixels that match on pairs or on several images, also printing the name of the reference images 

At the prompt, the parameters required for analysis can be set.
The input procedure is gui
